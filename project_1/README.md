# DATA EXPLORATION OF MULTIPLE CSV FILES WITH R BASE ONLY

This is an introdutory tutorial for R begginers who might be interested in learning how to perform data analysis using R.  
In this tutorial I only utillize the basic functionality in R so no external R package involved.   
The tutorial:   

   
+ I begin with a zipped file as the orginal storage of our datasets.   
+ We extract zipped file to create an ordinary folder for access from R.   
+ our dataset consist of 332 csv files.  
    
**To view the analysis on the web open the specdata.md**
 
**To run the Project in your local machine**  
1. You need to have R and R studio installed.  
2. Navigate to a directory of your choice in you computer on terminal.  
3. Clone a repository on that directory.   
+ using HTTPS   
https://github.com/sam-karis/Data-Analysis.git   
+ using SSH    
[git@github.com:sam-karis/Data-Analysis.git]
4. Then Run the **specdata.Rmd** file.
